/** @file inparser.h
 * @brief        Parse ASCII text, in place, very quickly.
 * @author       John W. Ratcliff
 * @date         December 3, 2003

 * This class provides for high speed in-place (destructive) parsing of an ASCII text file.
 * This class will either load an ASCII text file from disk, or can be constructed with a pointer to
 * a piece of ASCII text in memory.  It can only be called once, and the contents are destroyed.
 * To speed the process of parsing, it simply builds pointers to the original ascii data and replaces the
 * seperators with a zero byte to indicate end of string.  It performs callbacks to parse each line, in argc/argv format,
 * offering the option to cancel the parsing process at any time.
 *
 *
 * Written by John W. Ratcliff on December 3, 2003 : This is 100% open source MEMALLOC_FREE for use by anybody.  I wrote this
 * implementation as part of the TinyVRML project.  However, this parser can be used for any purposes.
 *
 * By default the only valid seperator is whitespace.  It will not treat commas or any other symbol as a separator.
 * You can specify any character to be  a 'hard' seperator, such as an '=' for example and that will come back as a
 * distinct argument string.
 *
 * To use the parser simply inherit the pure virtual base class 'InPlaceParserInterface'.  Define the method 'ParseLine'.
 * When you invoke the Parse method on the InPlaceParser class, you will get an ARGC - ARGV style callback for each line
 * in the source file.  If you return 'false' at any time, it will abort parsing.  The entire thing is stack based, so you
 * can recursively call multiple parser instances.
 *
 * It is important to note.  Since this parser is 'in place' it writes 'zero bytes' (EOS marker) on top of the whitespace.
 * While it can handle text in quotes, it does not handle escape sequences.  This is a limitation which could be resolved.
 * There is a hard coded maximum limit of 512 arguments per line.
 *
 * Here is the full example usage:
 *
 *  InPlaceParser ipp("parse_me.txt");
 *
 *    ipp.Parse(this);
 *
 *  That's it, and you will receive an ARGC - ARGV callback for every line in the file.
 *
 *  If you want to parse some text in memory of your own. (It *MUST* be terminated by a zero byte, and lines seperated by carriage return
 *  or line-feed.  You will receive an assertion if it does not.  If you specify the source data than *you* are responsible for that memory
 *  and must de-allocate it yourself.  If the data was loaded from a file on disk, then it is automatically de-allocated by the InPlaceParser.
 *
 *  You can also construct the InPlaceParser without passing any data, so you can simply pass it a line of data at a time yourself.  The
 *  line of data should be zero-byte terminated.
